# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN and Deep Learning

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning techniques to predict plant diseases from images. By training on a labeled dataset of plant images, the model can classify different plant diseases, which could help farmers and researchers monitor crop health and take timely preventive measures.

## Introduction

Plant disease detection is crucial in agriculture to reduce crop losses and ensure food security. Traditional methods require expert knowledge and are often time-consuming. This project uses deep learning to automate the detection of plant diseases, allowing for faster and more accessible diagnoses.

## Features

- Image classification using CNN for plant disease prediction
- High accuracy on a variety of plant disease types
- Scalable to include more plant species and disease types

## Dataset

The model is trained on a publicly available plant disease dataset, which contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plants. You can find similar datasets from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other open-source repositories.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a CNN architecture built using libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. Key layers include:

- Convolutional Layers for feature extraction
- Pooling Layers for dimensionality reduction
- Dense Layers for classification

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thefalcon17/Plant-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Plant-Disease-Prediction
